    <description>This mod provides additional precepts for ideoligions in the Ideology DLC. This is work in progress, currently 4 are provided, more are planned.

- Elderly - Old people may be viewed with respect or contempt. Results in mood and social buffs and debuffs. When elders are respected, too young pawns are considered inexperienced for important roles.
- Traps - Use of traps may be disapproved. Analogous to the 'Autonomous weapons' precept, but for traps.
- Superstition - Strong, mild or contempt. Superstitious pawns will get mood changes from some events, pawns with contempt will dislike others being superstitious.
- Violence - Harming other people, ranging from pacifists that refuse to harm others to essential that makes pawns unhappy after a while of no violence.
